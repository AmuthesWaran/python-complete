# Tuple - Read only list
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
# Tuples are written with round brackets.

point = (1, 2) + (3, 4)
# print(type(point))
print(point)
point = (1, 2) * 2
print(point)


# To convert list to a tuple
point = tuple([1, 2])
print(point)
print(type(point))

# Accessing using index
print(point[0])


point = (1, 2)
print(type(point))

point = 1, 2
print(type(point))
